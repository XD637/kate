            Hi! Iâ€™m Kate, an artist specializing in pencil and charcoal
            drawings. My passion is capturing emotion and detail in every
            portrait and illustration. Each piece is crafted with patience,
            love, and a touch of soul. Thank you for visiting my gallery and
            supporting my journey!
